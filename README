== Welcome to Austin

Development has just started.

Goals:

1.  Provide a way to store information about clients, services and hours allowed as they arrive in paper form from regional service centers.
 
2.  Provide a way for various staff members to plan and track the delivery of services authorized in (1).  This should include showing unallocated service hours for a given client, to permit rescheduling and adding bookings to fully provide all services for which each client is entitled.  It should provide a way to confirm that a scheduled service was either delivered or cancelled, allowing billing totals to be accrued for subsequent reporting to the regional center.

3.  Provide a way for therapists conducting group services to mark attendance in a way to confirm that a scheduled service was delivered, allowing billing totals to be accrued for subsequent reporting to the regional center.

4.  Provide a way for Tim and Kimberly to view the future schedules/unallocated hours for therapists to assist in discussions with regional centers who may be proposing additional client load.

5.  Devise a more efficient way to report utilized service hours to the regional centers than the current manual update for each client on their website.

6.  Upload existing machine-readable data regarding clients, services and hours into the new system, so that it will be ready for use.

7.  Provide various reports (these haven't been defined yet).
